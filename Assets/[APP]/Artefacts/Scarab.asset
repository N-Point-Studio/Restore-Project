  artifactName: Winged Scarab
  code: CH0267
  history: 'This winged scarab consists of three pieces: an actual scarab beetle
    and two separately made wings. The wings are not those of a beetle, but those
    of a bird, as is apparent by their shape and the indication of individual feathers.
    Each piece features several small holes that were used to fasten the winged scarab
    to the wrappings of a mummy. Winged scarabs, meant to guarantee the rebirth of
    the deceased, were very popular funerary amulets.'
